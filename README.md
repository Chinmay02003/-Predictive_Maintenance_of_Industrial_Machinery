# -Predictive_Maintenance_of_Industrial_Machinery
A machine learning project to develop a predictive maintenance model for industrial machinery. The model uses sensor data to classify and anticipate failures (e.g., tool wear, power failure), enabling proactive maintenance and reducing downtime. It uses IBM Cloud Lite services.
